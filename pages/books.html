                </a>

                <p>The Shreemad Bhagavad Gita is one of the most ancient scriptures in the world. <br>
                Of all the scriptures, it is said that Gita provides the deepest and most <br>
                practical knowledge about faith, devotion, surrender, detachment, and <br>
                a release of expectations and ownership over one's own actions.</p>

                </a>

                <p>Despite being compiled long ago by Sage Veda Vyasa, the message of the Shreemad Bhagavatam <br>
                is very relevant today. Its verses prove that whenever humanity is most in need, the Divine <br>
                manifests Itself on Earth to answer the call of the sincere devotees, and to re-establish <br>
                balance, right action, and the life-affirming power of Divine Love. </p>

                </a>

                <p>Life has been given so that we may rediscover our true Self, and what lies beyond that. <br>
                Discovering the Self may seem like the ultimate goal, but there is something even greater. <br>
                The ultimate bliss is found when we go deeper within that Self and discover the Lord </br>
                seated within our heart. This is the true aim of life. </p>
